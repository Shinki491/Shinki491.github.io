                <p>Tiramisu:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Quality Ingredients: Invest in high-quality ingredients, especially for the coffee and mascarpone cheese. Fresh, rich flavors will make a noticeable difference in your Tiramisu.</li>
                    <li>Soaking Time: Be mindful of the soaking time for the ladyfingers. Dip them briefly into the coffee mixture to prevent them from becoming too soggy and losing their texture.</li>
                    <li>Layering Technique: Aim for even layers of ladyfingers and mascarpone cream to ensure a balanced taste and texture in every bite. Take your time to arrange the layers neatly for a visually appealing presentation.</li>
                    <li>Chilling Time: Allow the Tiramisu to chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld together and for the dessert to set properly.</li>
                    <li>Cocoa Powder: Use high-quality cocoa powder for dusting the top of the Tiramisu. It adds a rich flavor and a touch of elegance to the final presentation.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Cheesecake:</p>
                <ol start="6">
                    <li>Room Temperature Ingredients: Ensure that all the ingredients, especially the cream cheese and eggs, are at room temperature before you begin mixing. This ensures a smooth and creamy texture in the final cheesecake.</li>
                    <li>Avoid Overmixing: Mix the cheesecake batter until just combined. Overmixing can incorporate too much air into the batter, leading to cracks on the surface of the cheesecake as it bakes.</li>
                    <li>Water Bath Method: Consider using a water bath when baking your cheesecake. This gentle heat distribution helps prevent cracking and ensures a silky texture throughout.</li>
                    <li>Cooling Process: After baking, allow the cheesecake to cool gradually. Start by letting it cool in the turned-off oven with the door slightly ajar, then transfer it to the refrigerator to chill completely before serving.</li>
                    <li>Creative Toppings: Get creative with your cheesecake toppings! Fresh berries, chocolate ganache, caramel sauce, or fruit compote are just a few delicious options to enhance the flavor and presentation of your cheesecake.</li>
